## Project 02


### Objective: Automate the setup of a multi-tier web application stack with separate database and application servers using Ansible.

### Problem Statement


### Objective: Automate the deployment and configuration of a multi-tier web application stack consisting of:

Database Server: Set up a PostgreSQL database server on one Ubuntu instance.

Application Server: Set up a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) on another Ubuntu instance to host a web application.

Application Deployment: Ensure the web application is deployed on the application server and is configured to connect to the PostgreSQL database on the database server.

Configuration Management: Use Ansible to automate the configuration of both servers, including the initialization of the database and the deployment of the web application.

### Deliverables

#### Ansible Inventory File

Filename: inventory.ini

Content: Defines the database server and application server instances, including their IP addresses and connection details.

To verify we will ping the server using following ad-hoc command

`ansible all -i inventory.ini -m ping`

#### Ansible Playbook

+ Filename: deploy_multitier_stack.yml

+ Content: Automates:
+ The deployment and configuration of the PostgreSQL database server.
+ The setup and configuration of the web server.
+ The deployment of the web application and its configuration to connect to the database.
